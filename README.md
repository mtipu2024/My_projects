It's a part of our final M. Sc. research project where we developed a dashboard to addressed the challenges novice investors face in the stock market by proposing the development of a “self-guided investment platform,” empowering them with fundamental financial literacy and a predictive stock outlook. The methodology involves building a dynamic financial literacy hub with predictive modeling, leveraging business intelligence tools and machine learning algorithms. The first contribution of this study is its financial literacy dashboard using 10 stocks from the S&P 500 index. We developed a Power BI dashboard explaining the selected company’s financial metrics to help users with fundamental stock investment knowledge. Second, we proposed a hybrid LSTM-GARCH model to predict stock prices to aid their investment decision-making further. The accuracy measures of the hybrid model demonstrate a good fit for the chosen stocks. Finally, we integrated the hybrid predictive modeling with the Power BI dashboard. This platform will improve investors’ confidence by providing fundamental financial literacy and enabling them to adopt apt trading strategies utilizing predictive modeling performance.
